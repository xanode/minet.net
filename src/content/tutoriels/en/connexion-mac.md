## Prerequisites

To register your devices on the MiNET network, you will need to add your MAC addresses to your account. If you don't know how to do this, don't hesitate to follow the tutorial [Add devices to your MiNET account](/tutorials/add-devices), which will guide you through the process.

## Connecting to the Wired Network

- Plug in your cable.
- After a few seconds, a window will prompt you for your credentials. Enter your MiNET credentials.
- Click "Continue" when the window asking you to verify the certificate appears.
- Enter your Mac's password (not MiNET!) in the following window.
- You are now connected! Internet access should be established within seconds.
