## Prerequisites

To register your devices on the MiNET network, you will need to add your MAC addresses to your account. If you don't know how to do this, don't hesitate to follow the tutorial [Add devices to your MiNET account](/en/tutoriels/ajouter-des-appareils), which will guide you through the process.

## Setting Up Your PC with Linux (Wi-Fi)

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to configure your computer with Linux using Network Manager to benefit from a WiFi internet connection on MiNET.

### Connecting to MiNET WiFi

Through your notification area, find and connect to one of the two MiNET WiFi networks mentioned earlier (choose based on your devices).

### Configuration Setup

In case your connection isn't configured yet, a window should open. Inside it, you will need to:

- Check the "No CA certificate is required" box.
- Enter your credentials and passwords in the "Username" and "Password" fields.
- Finally, close the window by clicking "Save."
