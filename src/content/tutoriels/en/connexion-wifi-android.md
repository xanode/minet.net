## Prerequisites

To register your devices on the MiNET network, you will need to add your MAC addresses to your account. If you don't know how to do this, don't hesitate to follow the tutorial [Add devices to your MiNET account](/en/tutoriels/ajouter-des-appareils), which will guide you through the process.

## Connecting Your Mobile Device

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to configure your mobile device to benefit from a WiFi internet connection on MiNET. Go to your phone's settings and:

- Navigate to WiFi.
- Select "MiNET" based on your hardware.
- Enter your credentials and passwords in the "Identities" and "Password" fields.
- If you are asked to enter an "Anonymous" field, leave it blank.
- Verify that the "EAP authentication method," "Phase 2 authentication," and "CA Certificate" fields have the values "PEAP," "MSCHAPV2," and "Do not validate," respectively.
- NEW: If an "MAC address type" option appears, choose "Use the phone's MAC address."
- NEW: If a "Domain" option appears, enter: "minet.net."
- Finally, click "Connect."

The connection and internet access should be established within seconds. If not, please note that a restart may be necessary.
