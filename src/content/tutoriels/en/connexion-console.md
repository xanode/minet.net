## To connect your PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo Switch to the network.

- The first step is to find the wired MAC address of your console, you should find it in the parameters
- Then add it to your account by going on [ADH6](https://adh6.minet.net/) and add it as a  *new wired device*
- Then send us a [ticket](https://tickets.minet.net/), specify your login, your room number and the MAC address of your console and we can authorize its connection on our side.

## Why this whole procedure ?

Please note that these consoles do not support the 802.1X authentication we use (enterprise network type), so we must specifically allow the MAC address of your console to connect. This can only be done via cable and not via WiFi.
