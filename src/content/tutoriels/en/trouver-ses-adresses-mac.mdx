MiNET offers an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service, allowing you to watch digital terrestrial and satellite channels directly on your PC. To access this service, you need to be a MiNET member, live in Maison de l'Ã‰tudiant (Maisel), and connect your computer directly to the Ethernet port in your room. Please note that TV streaming is not available via Wi-Fi or behind a router.

Once the download is complete, launch the VLC installation (you can follow the instructions available on the [VLC Wiki](https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Installing_VLC/)).

Next, you'll need to download the <a href="/TV-MiNET.xspf" download>MiNET TV playlist</a>.
