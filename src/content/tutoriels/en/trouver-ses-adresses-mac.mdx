The MAC address serves as a unique identifier for each of your interfaces (both WiFi and wired) and is necessary for adding a new device to our network.

## How to Find Your MAC Address?

A MAC address is typically represented in hexadecimal form like `5A-FF-56-A2-AF-15` or `5A:FF:56:A2:AF:15`. There are various methods to find it, depending on the operating system you are using. We have listed the most common ones below.

### Windows

- Press the following key combination <KBD>Windows+R</KBD> to open the *Run* window.
- Type `cmd` and then press <KBD>Enter</KBD> to open the command prompt.
- Type `getmac -v` and then press <KBD>Enter</KBD> to obtain a list of the device's MAC addresses.
- The MAC address is located in the *Physical Address* column.
- The first line generally corresponds to your wired network card, and the second to your WiFi network card.

### GNU/Linux

- Open a terminal.
- Type `ip link show` followed by <KBD>Enter</KBD> for a summary of the device's interfaces.
- Look for fields with *eth* or *enp* (for wired) or *wlan* or *wlp* (for WiFi).
- Then look for the MAC address following the desired interface, just after the *link/ether* field.

You will thus obtain your MAC addresses.

### macOS

- In the search bar, type `terminal` and then press <KBD>Enter</KBD>.
- Then type `networksetup -listallhardwareports` followed by <KBD>Enter</KBD>.

The *Ethernet Address* field corresponds to your MAC addresses.

### Android

- Go to your smartphone's settings.
- Look for the *About Phone* section.
- Find the *Status* field.

Your MAC address is displayed next to *Wi-Fi MAC Address*.

### PS4 and Xbox

- Go to the console settings.
- Look for the *Network* section.
- Open the *View Connection Status* menu for PS4 or *Advanced Settings* for Xbox.

Your MAC address is displayed next to *MAC Address (LAN)*.
