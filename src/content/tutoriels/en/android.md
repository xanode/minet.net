## Prerequisites

In order to register devices on the MiNET network, you have to add your MAC addresses on your account. To do so, you can follow the instructions on [Adding new devices on your MiNET account](/en/tutoriels/ajouter-des-appareils).

## Connect your mobile

By following this tutorial, you will see how to configure your mobile to use the MiNET WiFi connexion.

- Go to WiFi menu
- Select "MiNET" or "MiNET HD" depending on your device
- Enter your login and password in the fields "Identity" and "Password"
- If you're asked to fill an "Anonymous" field, please leave it empty
- Check that the fields "EAP method", "Phase-2 authentication" and "CA certificate" are filled with "PEAP", "MSCHAPV2" and "Do not validate"
 - <span class="text-red-600">NEW</span> : If you're asked to choose your "MAC address type", choose "Use Phone MAC"
 - <span class="text-red-600">NEW</span> : If you're asked to enter a domain name, enter "minet.net"
 - Click on "Connect"

Once all of these steps are done, you only have to wait a few seconds, and you should be automatically connected on the â€œMiNET". Take note that the authentication can take a few seconds. Sometimes, rebooting your phone is necessary.
