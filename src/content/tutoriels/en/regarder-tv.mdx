## Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)

MiNET offers an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service, allowing you to watch digital terrestrial and satellite channels directly on your PC. To access this service, you need to be a MiNET member, live in Maison de l'Étudiant (Maisel), and connect your computer directly to the Ethernet port in your room. Please note that TV streaming is not available via Wi-Fi or behind a router.

## Download and Install VLC Player and the MiNET Playlist

If you haven't already installed the VLC media player on your PC, visit [the VLC website](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/#download) to download a version of VLC compatible with your operating system.

Once the download is complete, launch the VLC installation (you can follow the instructions available on the [VLC Wiki](https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Installing_VLC/)).

Next, you'll need to download the <a href="/TV-MiNET.xspf" download>MiNET TV playlist</a>.

## Using VLC Player

To watch TV, follow these steps:
- Open VLC.
- Click on *Media*.
- Go to *Open File*.
- Select the MiNET TV playlist.

The television stream will start playing!

Here are some useful shortcuts:
- Use the <KBD keys={["F"]} /> key (Full Screen) to switch to full-screen mode or exit it.
- Use the <KBD keys={["N"]} /> key (Next) to switch to the next channel and the <KBD keys={["P"]} /> key (Previous) to switch to the previous channel.
- Use the <KBD keys={["Ctrl", "L"]} /> key combination (List) to view the list of available channels.
